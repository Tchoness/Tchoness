### Hi there 👋


### 🚀 Expertise
Passionate about technology since the age of 16, I took my first steps into programming during my Mechatronics technician course. At 18, I had the exciting opportunity to apply my knowledge, developing projects tailored for the industry using C++ and Ladder.

Throughout my journey, I worked as a Junior Backend Developer, delving into the vast universe of embedded software. My toolkit includes Python, with experience in renowned frameworks like Django and Flask.

🌐 Beyond my professional environment, I am an enthusiast of extreme sports, a passionate gamer (any FPS is my domain), an avid reader, and always eager to understand where technology is heading. Currently, my focus of study lies in the fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence.

Let's explore the technological future together! 🚀🔧🤖
